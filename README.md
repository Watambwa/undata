Predictive Analytics for Early Warning Systems: Enhancing Resilience and Response Strategies in Agricultural and Fishing Communities

Predictive analytics holds significant potential for improving early warning systems in agricultural and fishing communities, thereby enhancing their resilience and response strategies. Traditional methods have often proven inadequate in addressing the complex challenges faced by these communities, resulting in delayed responses and increased vulnerability. However, data science offers a novel approach to alleviate the production of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning algorithms, data science models enable the early identification of potential shocks, providing timely warnings and facilitating proactive measures. This approach represents a paradigm shift, as it empowers communities to anticipate and mitigate disruptions, aligning with SDGs such as Zero Hunger, Climate Action, and Life Below Water. Through the integration of predictive analytics, this research aims to strengthen early warning systems, improve resource management, foster climate resilience, and promote sustainable practices in agricultural and fishing communities, ultimately contributing to the achievement of these SDGs.
